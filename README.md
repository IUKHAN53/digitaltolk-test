## My Comments on Given Code:
The code looks good and I enjoyed reading it, especially the use of repository pattern. I have less seen of it projects. but I believe it should be used more often.

### Refactoring
Although I skimmed through the code and added refactoring as much as possible I may have missed some points. In any case following are my thoughts on refactoring in the given code.

* Ensure functions return consistent formats for better maintainability.
* Fix logical errors in functions, handle failures properly.
* Validate and sanitize inputs to maintain data integrity.
* Use self-explanatory variable names for clarity.
* Stick to consistent PHP variable naming conventions.
* Prefer Eloquent or query builder over DB::table for queries.
* Use function-based helpers instead of class-based static helpers.
* Explicitly declare access types for functions.
* Choose one array syntax (array() or []) and be consistent.
* Always use curly braces with conditional statements to avoid ambiguity.

Following these guidelines will lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.
